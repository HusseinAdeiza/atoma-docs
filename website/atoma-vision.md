# Atoma vision

The Atoma Network is a next generation permissionless decentralized protocol specialized for heavy verifiable compute. More precisely,
the Atoma Network derives its features from compute providers, which we refer to as execution nodes (or simply nodes). Nodes on the Atoma Network are responsible for processing different types of compute requests. 

## AWS lambda functionality

The Atoma Network provides features similar to AWS lambda functionality, in a complete decentralized and permissionless setting. In particular, Atoma node's can run arbitrary WASM application. In a well coordinated setting, these requests are efficiently handled by
nodes with high availability, which leads to greater levels of coordination. Moreover, having available multiple nodes running requests
in a decentralized setting leads to better request pricing, contrary to current centralized cloud solutions, which often charge high
margins for their services. In order to ensure security for the end-user (which submits the requests, in the first place) and also to the
actual node, we require WASM applications to run inside a trusted execution environment (TEE, in sort). This means that such WASM applications can not have access to read/write operations on disk, etc. Moreover, TEEs provide attestations which provide enough evidence
of the integrity of the output generated by such nodes executing such requests, through a given WASM application. Moreover, TEEs provide
full input and output privacy to the end user (nodes cannot have read access to both inputs and outputs, unless the node has capacity to
physically change the inner circuits of its CPU).

## AI inference

Requests include AI inference requests, or other types of general compute requests. AI inference requests often are processed through nodes that run Large Language models (LLMs) on (often) text inputs to generate either text responses or images (for multi-modality capabilities). Moreover, other types of AI models are supported as well (including more standard and traditional models for time series predictions, recommendation systems, etc. Notice that AI inference often requires access to powerful GPUs (like NVIDIA RTX4090, A100, etc). Contrary to CPUs (which TEEs are currently broadly available), only the actual higher caliber GPUs (like NVIDIA H100, which costs up to $30,000 and are very difficult to acquire) have TEE natively. Moreover, deploying CPU and GPU communication in a TEE setup is highly non-trivial. For this reason, we can't expect Atoma nodes to provide verifiable execution through TEEs. Instead, we have designed and developed a `sampling consensus` protocol to validate the state of each request's output generation. Roughly, speaking each request submitted into the Atoma Network randomly assigns a given number of nodes to execute such request (usually, 10 nodes already provide very high security guarantees). The cost of running such request corresponds to the native cost of running through a single node times the number of selected nodes, plus a given reward margin. Moreover, the Atoma Network does handle dispute mechanisms in case the sampled nodes to execute an inference, do not agree on the state of the output. Together with reputation and slashing mechanisms, nodes on the Atoma Network have no incentive to act maliciously, provided these are generally rational in an economic environment. 

## Smart contract enhancement 

Through verifiability, Atoma's nodes can provide higher levels of functionality to smart contracts on any blockchain. Smart contracts can
delegate heavy computations to Atoma nodes, in the form of requests for Atoma nodes to execute in a coordinated way, providing high assurance guarantees that computations were not tampered in any way. More concretely, smart contracts can offload AI computations, or other types of logic executions to Atoma. Atoma allows for the next Web3 applications to be built on top of its infrastructure, which
includes AI content generation, AI predictions, protein folding, WASM smart contracts on any blockchain, etc. It is like smart contracts can become both truly smart (and intelligent) and can be enhanced through a decentralized AWS lambda infrastructure (similar to a wide range of Web2 applications, already).

## Atoma as a general compute infrastructure layer

The Atoma Network sits in the middle of a DePin and a decentralized market place for compute. Atoma Network aggregates decentralized
compute in the form of a permissionless set of nodes, holding different types of hardware, similar a DePin network. However, there are fundamental differences with a DePin network. Usually, DePins are responsible for aggregating compute resources and managing payments
for resource utilization. On the contrary, nodes on the Atoma Network are responsible to subscribe to very specific compute tasks. These
tasks can be for example running AI compute on a given specific model (that the model specifies upon registring on the Atoma Network protocol), or running a protein folding algorithm inside a TEE. However, once a node subscribes to a given compute task, it cannot provide compute to different tasks (that it didn't subscribe to). In this regard, Atoma nodes provide the offer side of a market place,
in which requests to the Atoma Network represent the demand side of the network. Moreover, nodes on the Atoma Network are subject
to deposit collateral to participate onto the network. Moreover, the Atoma Network protocol puts forth both reputation and slashing
mechanisms to make sure that nodes execute compute tasks, to which these have subscribed too, in the most performant and trusted possible way. Finally, the Atoma Network open source software provides infrastructure for compute serving. This means, that nodes only need to clone the Atoma's node infrastructure open source repository, build the binaries and execute them. The Atoma Network binaries allows nodes to listen to blockchain events, to execute requests, as well as providing all the infrastructure (including downloading AI model weights, WASM binaries, etc from external APIs) in a fully automatic way. Therefore, apart from the hardware and electricity costs, node
operators have very little work to run nodes (except for monitoring and deal with potential causes of node shutdown, such as electricity shutdowns, etc).
